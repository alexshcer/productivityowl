=============================================================================
The Productivity Owl will eliminate your time wasting habits on the internet.  

Instead of just blacklisting certain websites, the productivity owl is present on every page.  

He allows a certain amount of time to get the info you need, then get out.  This creates a system where you learn to find what you need fast.  If you don't go fast to beat the owl's timer, the owl will close the page's tab for you.  

Of course work-related websites (and search engine pages) can be given a free pass.  On these pages, you will have all the time you need. Just set those websites as "Allowed Websites" in the options.  

Certain sites such as Facebook and Youtube should be set as "Blocked Websites" in the options. 

You must plan all your breaks in advance with the "Freetime Scheduler." During "Freetime" the owl will not close your tabs.

*** WARNING: This extension is very annoying.  The owl is constantly flying across your pages, annoying you, and closing your tabs.  If you are not serious about being productive, this extension may not be for you.***

****************************************************************************************
Version 1.1

This version is still not a final release.  It just fixes some bugs and updates to Manifest 2.  

Note: Anti-Desperation mode still doesn't work correctly.  The owl is supposed to catch on when you are "desperately"
refreshing the page, or clicking links to reset the timer.  I plan to have him insult you, and close the tab in that scenario.

Note on Release 1.1:
Thanks to everyone who has been using the Productivity Owl. The first release was experimental, and I never thought to update the extension to fix old bugs 
since there were only "20 current users."  Then suddenly there were 3000 users.  When I tried to update I ran into Google's Manifest Version 2 which 
delayed the release further.  Thanks for being patient.
